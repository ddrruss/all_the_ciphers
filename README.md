# all_the_ciphers
A program that will enable the user to encrypt, decode, and hack secret messages. 
This is the first program I have ever tried to write in a user friendlyish format. I wrote it to teach myself about classes and gain familiarity with python. 
Overall this is only the second program I have ever written and the functional components are modified from Al Sweigart's book cracking codes with python. I plan to add several other cipher programs like the affine and RSA cipher and allow the user to pick which cipher they would like to work with. This is to teach myself to code. I realize it looks far from professional but that is what learning is all about. 

To run program:
1. Ensure all files are in the same folder. 
2. Copy the file path. Should look something like C:\Users\UserName\Documents\python_work\Codes and Cyphers\Reverse Cypher Working File
3. Ensure python three is installed and then open command line terminal. 
4. Paste the file path after typing "cd" into the command line and press enter. 
5. Type "python reverse_transfer_cypher.py" (I know cypher is spelled wrong... I suck at spelling and never fixed it...)
6. The program should now be runnning. You can follow the prompts to encrypt, decrypt or hack a message either by pasting it into the command prompt or placing its text file in the appropriate file with the rest of the .py files. 
7. I hate ending on just 6 steps. So here is the seventh. Go forth and mess around with it for 10 minutes before it gets boring.
