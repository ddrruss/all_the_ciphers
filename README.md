# all_the_ciphers
A program that will enable the user to encrypt, decode, and hack secret messages. 
This is the first program I have ever tried to write in a user friendlyish format. I wrote it to teach myself about classes and gain familiarity with python. 
Overall this is only the second program I have ever written and the functional components are modified from Al Sweigart's book cracking codes with python. I plan to add several other cipher programs like the affine and RSA cipher and allow the user to pick which cipher they would like to work with.
